# The first day by neue Fische

Today I learned that version control is an essential part of my career as web developer.

Some keywords that I should remember for later are:

- git,
- GitHub,
- version control,
- repository,
- commit and hash.

The next 3 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
