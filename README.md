# The first day by neue Fische

Today I learned that version control is an essential part of my career as web developer.

Some keywords that I should remember for later are:

- git,
- GitHub,
- version control,
- repository,
- commit and hash.

my hobbys are :
- music
- youtube videos 
- sports 

languages:

- French
- Arabic
- german
- english

I wish that the next 3 months will be very exciting, as I will learn new things every day.
